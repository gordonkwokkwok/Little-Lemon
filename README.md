# Prerequisite
Creating a virtual environment is recommended for projects, and either venv or conda can be used based on personal preference. After creating the virtual environment, it is necessary to activate it before installing any required libraries, such as the Django framework and Django REST framework.

## Tool
```
Visual Studio Code (Version: 1.75.1)
Git (Version: 2.23.0)
Conda (Version: 22.9.0)
Python (Version: 3.9.6)
pip (Version: 23.0.1)
MySQL(Version: 8.0.32 for macos13.0 on x86_64 (Homebrew))
Insomnia REST client
```

## Library / Framework
```
Use "pip3 install " command to install the following libraries:
pip3 install Django (Version: 4.1)
pip3 install virtualenv (or use conda virtual environment)
pip3 install mysqlclientÂ 
pip3 install djangorestframework (Add 'rest_framework' in setting.py file in the installed apps list)
pip3 install djoser (Add 'djoser' in setting.py file in the installed apps list, and ensure that it is placed after the 'rest_framework' app in the list.)
```

# Command to create a Django project and an app:
```
conda activate djangoEnv (activate the conda virtual environment)
django-admin startproject littlelemon
cd littlelemon
